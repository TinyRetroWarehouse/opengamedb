# opengamedb
A truly open CSV based database for video games.

Game launchers have a problem; Scraping. Video game data is currently difficult to get because either the databases have to limit the number of requests they handle due to zero funding, or they are owned by a corporation that monetizes via ads and has no incentive to allow you direct access to their data.

I'm proposing that we keep a CSV formatted database here on github which can be easily distributed with whatever software might need access to this data to limit the amount of scraping we have to do after setting up a new game launcher.
