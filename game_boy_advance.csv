The Stage Fatalities are completely absent from the game, as well as the final sequence, in which the castle of Shao Kahn explodes and Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures. The Stages The Subway, Jade's Desert and Waterfront were not included. The Street stage, that appeared in Mortal Kombat 3, was included, but not the detail of the papers fluttering. The stage Lost Bridge appears, although not among the stages where you can fight as it appears in the background as you are choosing the Towers of Destiny to fight the computer.",https://gamefaqs.akamaized.net/box/9/6/7/15967_front.jpg
