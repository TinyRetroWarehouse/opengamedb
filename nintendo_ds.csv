Throughout the game, the player is offered an amount of money or prizes to quit, being asked the titular question, ""Deal or no deal?"" If the contestant rejects every deal and eliminates all the other cases or boxes, the player keeps the money that was in the original case or box. Thus, the contestant ""wins"" depending on whether the player should have taken one of the deals or should have held onto the original case or box until the very end.",https://images.launchbox-app.com/9c515003-dd1a-4474-ac8b-08cabc11a6c2.jpg
